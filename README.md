Project status: (in progress)

Vim bundle for quickly typing latex, pandoc and markdown files

Built as an improved version of quicktex, this bundle extends the functionality of quicktex to markdown.

## Editing preferred keybindings
You can access the keybinding dictionaries in the `ftplugin` directory. Each file with the `.vim` extension is the dictionary to that language. One can easily set their preffered keybindings to this ibrary ba adding them to the list, or change them entirely to their liking.

## Importing and installing the Bundle using Vundle
(in progress)
